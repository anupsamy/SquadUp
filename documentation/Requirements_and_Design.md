## 2. Project Description

The target audience for SquadUp is anybody who hates dealing with dead group chats, last-minute RSVPs, or the headache that comes with figuring out a gathering place when trying to celebrate an occasion. This demographic includes students, young professionals, and community groups with members spread out over a geographical area – anybody with a busy schedule that doesn’t have time to read through long text threads and supply input on the plan.

SquadUp aims to solve the friction of planning group meetups: long back-and-forth chats, infrequent communication, and disagreements over where to meet. By having one Squad Leader create the event with a given time, Squad Members can input their locations in order to receive a list of meeting place suggestions. The suggestions will be calculated using a “midpoint” calculation algorithm, using relative location data from the Google Maps API.

One of the most interesting technical highlights of the MeetUp Planner project is the optimization of using Google Maps and user inputs. This enables the app to propose meetup options that are both time-feasible and geographically fair—such as suggesting a café that minimizes total travel time for the group.

![Mock Up 8](images/Mockup-8.png)

### **3.7. Non-Functional Requirements**

<a name="nfr1"></a>

1. **Location Optimization Response Time**
    - **Requirement**: The system shall return location optimization results (midpoint calculation and venue suggestions) within 2 to 5 seconds of the squad leader triggering the algorithm.  
    - **Justification**: Location optimization is the core feature of SquadUp. If results take too long, users lose patience and the app fails at its main promise of simplifying group planning. Research on web/app usability shows that 31% of participants found a 2-second delay acceptable, and less than 20% tolerated a 5-second delay. Therefore, we aim for ideally 3 seconds, with a lower bound of 2 seconds and upper bound of 5 seconds. Latency also affects scalability.  
    - **Testability**: This can be validated using UI tests (measure time from button click to results rendered) and API load tests (measure server-side algorithm runtime and API latency).  

<a name="nfr2"></a>

2. **Squad View Load Time**
    - **Requirement**: The system must load squad details (attendees, event time, squad status) within 2 seconds after a user selects a squad.  
    - **Justification**: Squad View is the most frequently accessed screen. Ensuring quick load maintains user engagement and supports the app’s goal of frictionless event coordination. Human–computer interaction studies suggest actions should respond within 1 second to feel fluid and keep user attention.  
    - **Testability**: This can be measured with UI performance tests (screen render time after click) and API profiling (database query and response time checks).

## 4. Designs Specification
## 4. Design Specification

## 4. Designs Specification
### **4.1. Main Components**

1. **User Management Service**
    - **Purpose**: Handles user authentication, authorization, and profile CRUD (e.g., name, email, travel preferences).  
    - **Rationale**: Users persist across multiple events, so identity must be managed independently of event data. Keeping this service separate allows easy integration with third-party auth providers (Google, SSO) and ensures security boundaries are clear.  
    - **Interfaces**:  
        1. `suspend fun googleSignIn(tokenId: String): Result<AuthData>`  
            - **Purpose**: Frontend + Google Auth Service (POST) interface, returns authentication data upon sign-in success.  
        2. `suspend fun googleSignUp(tokenId: String): Result<AuthData>`  
            - **Purpose**: Frontend + Google Auth Service (POST) interface, returns authentication data upon sign-up success.  
        3. `suspend fun deleteAccount(): Result<Unit>`  
            - **Purpose**: HTTP (DELETE) interface between database + profile repository. Deletes the account of the currently logged in user.  
        4. `suspend fun getProfile(): Result<User>`

            - **Purpose**: HTTP (POST) interface between profile repository and database. Returns saved profile data upon success.  
        6. `suspend fun updateProfilePicture(profilePictureUrl: String): Result<User>`  
            - **Purpose**: HTTP (POST) interface between profile repository and database. Returns updated photo upon success.  

2. **Group Management Service**
    - **Purpose**: Provides CRUD operations for events and manages their participant lists. Since groups are single-use, event records also serve as the representation of group membership.  
    - **Rationale**: Folding group logic into event management avoids redundancy and simplifies the model. This keeps all participation and scheduling information in one place, reducing coupling and making the service easier to extend.  
    - **Interfaces**:  
        1. `suspend fun getGroups(): Result<List<GroupDataDetailed>>`  
            - **Purpose**: HTTP (GET) request to database from group repository. Returns list of all existing groups upon success.  
        2. `suspend fun createGroup(groupName: String, meetingTime: String, groupLeaderId: GroupUser, expectedPeople: Number, activityType: String): Result<GroupData>`  
            - **Purpose**: HTTP (POST) request to database from group repository. Returns group info upon success.  
        3. `suspend fun getGroupByJoinCode(joinCode: String): Result<GroupDataDetailed>`

            - **Purpose**: HTTP (POST) with join code and user data as body. Updates database with current user data, returns success.  
        6. `suspend fun updateGroup(joinCode: String, expectedPeople: Number?, updatedMembers: List<GroupUser>?, meetingTime: String?): Result<Unit>`  
            - **Purpose**: HTTP (POST) with join code, user data, and expected people as body. Updates database, returns success.  
        7. `suspend fun leaveGroup(joinCode: String, userId: String): Result<Unit>`  
            - **Purpose**: HTTP (POST) with join code as request parameter and user data as body. Removes corresponding user from group in database.

        10. `suspend fun getMidpoints(joinCode: String): Result<List<LatLng>>`  
            - **Purpose**: HTTP (GET) request with join code. Returns list of potential midpoints (coordinates) from location service.  

3. **Location Optimizer**
    - **Purpose**: Calculates fair meetup spots for events by combining group members’ locations with external APIs (Google Maps for travel times).  
    - **Rationale**: Isolating the optimization logic as a dedicated service prevents the event service from becoming bloated with complex computation and API integration. It also makes it easier to swap or extend algorithms (e.g., adding a density-based or ML-driven approach later).  
    - **Interfaces**:  
        1. `suspend fun getPredictions(query: String): List<AutocompletePrediction>`  
            - **Purpose**: Queries Google Places API for autocomplete suggestions for a given location query.  
        2. `suspend fun fetchPlace(placeId: String): Address?`  
            - **Purpose**: Queries Google Places API for an address and formats it according to SquadUp’s address type.  
        3. `async getTravelTime(origin: GeoLocation, destination: GeoLocation): Promise<number>`  
            - **Purpose**: Queries Google Maps API to find travel time between an origin and destination. Used for calculating the optimal midpoint.  
        4. `suspend fun getMidpointByJoinCode(joinCode: String): Result<MidpointActivitiesResponse>`  
            - **Purpose**: HTTP (GET) with join code. Runs backend midpoint algorithm, updates group info in database, and returns midpoint.  
        5. `async getActivityList(location: GeoLocation, type: string = "restaurant", radius: number = 1000, maxResults: number = 10): Promise<Activity[]>`  
            - **Purpose**: Interface with Google Maps API to get activities near midpoint, used in `getActivities` interface for frontend.  

4. **Notification Service**
    - **Purpose**: Sends timely updates to users, including RSVP confirmations, reminders, and last-minute changes, via push notifications.  
    - **Rationale**: Running notifications as an asynchronous background service prevents delays in the main user workflow. Decoupling also allows the system to scale independently and adopt different channels without touching core event logic.  
    - **Interfaces**:  
        1. `export async function sendGroupLeaveFCM(joinCode: string, userName: string, groupName: string, actingUserId: string)`  
            - **Purpose**: Interface between Firebase Messaging and backend for users leaving a group.  
        2. `export async function sendGroupJoinFCM(joinCode: string, userName: string, groupName: string, actingUserId: string)`  
            - **Purpose**: Interface between Firebase Messaging and backend for users joining a group.  
        3. `public notifyGroupJoin(joinCode: string, userId: string, userName: string, groupName: string)`  
            - **Purpose**: Interface between Firebase Messaging and WebSocket service to notify users of group join events.  
        4. `public notifyGroupUpdate(joinCode: string, message: string, data?: any)`  
            - **Purpose**: Interface between Firebase Messaging and WebSocket service to notify users of group updates (e.g., midpoint changes).  
        5. `public notifyGroupLeave(joinCode: string, userId: string, userName: string, groupName: string)`  
            - **Purpose**: Interface between Firebase Messaging and WebSocket service to notify users when a member leaves a group.  




### **4.2. Databases**
1. **MongoDB**
    - **Purpose**: Storage of all user and group information.

[SEQUENCE_DIAGRAM_HERE]
2. ...


### **4.7. Design and Ways to Test Non-Functional Requirements**

1. [**Location Optimization Response Time**](#nfr1)  
    - **Validation**: The location optimization algorithm uses parallel API calls with `Promise.all()` to fetch travel times concurrently from Google Maps Distance Matrix API during each iteration, reducing total network latency from sequential to concurrent execution. Early convergence detection (epsilon threshold check) and a maximum of 20 iterations are enforced. Previously calculated midpoints are cached in the database for instant return if the group configuration hasn't changed. The initial geographic midpoint calculation is performed in-memory without external API calls, providing a fast starting point for iterative refinement.

2. [**Group View Load Time**](#nfr2)  
    - **Validation**: The Group View fetches all group details including attendees, event time, and status in one atomic operation via a single indexed database query on the `joinCode` field (`findByJoinCode()`), avoiding multiple round trips. MongoDB's indexed `findOne()` operation provides O(log n) lookup performance, and the API endpoint returns the complete group document with all nested member information pre-populated, eliminating the need for additional join queries or data fetches.
